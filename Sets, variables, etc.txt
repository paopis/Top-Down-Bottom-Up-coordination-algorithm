In this document I describe all the variables/sets/etc. used in the GAMS project SmallLink,
written by Paolo Pisciella.

runit		run iteration (outer loop)
cuts(runit)	dynamic sat of cuts (initially empty)

converged	flag for convergence
checkout	flag signaling end of inner loop
iter_ord	reports number of outer iterations
iter_in		reports number of inner iterations

checks		set of convergence checks: (objz, y0ge, d_mult)
objz		objective value of BU
y0ge		amount of gas purchased by elec sector in year 0 (from TD)
d_mult		demand multiplier (for demand projections) (from TD)

i, i1, ii1	index set for tableau rows (1-133)
j, j1, jj1	index set for tableau columns (1-145)

I, J, sec	index set for sector in CGE model

A		original jacobian
Slack		matrix that indicates which equations need slack variables
Tab		LP tableau in terms of equality constraints

IB		list of inverse basis matrices 
dvar		list of dual variables (corresp to constraints)
dx		list of reduced costs (corresp to variables)

dualx		reduced cost of the variables
duale		shadow price of the constraints (dual variables)
x		solution values
b		RHS of equations
y		indicates whether variable/equation is basic
data, d		index set combining i and j (both equations and variables)
q		indicates how manyth basic variable/equation this is
qx		indicates how manyth basic variable this is
qxx		(same as qx?)
qe		
ne		total number of basic equations
nx		total number of basic variables
ind		indicates the position of basic variables/equations
Base		basis matrix, extracted from Tab
invb		inverse basis matrix (inverse of BB)
BB		base, but defined using a single index
Sens		inverse basis matrix times RHS (yields prediction in terms of basic variables)
test		dual variables times b (dual objective value, should equal primal objective)


new1		list of new convergence measures
prev1		list of old convergence measures
asave		used to store OBJZ.L
bsave		used to store D_mult
csave		used to store y0ge
eta_p		mcp variable that indicates which cut/basis matrix is active
yout		translates Sens to a decision vector y 
eout		
counter		
map		
iter		set of iteration numbers for outer loop
dev		deviation measure for predicted solution
chksens		smallest predicted value (should be at least zero)
converg		maximum deviation measure

dictmap		file that maps the rows/columns of the jacobian to the equations/variables in the model
