# Top-Down Bottom-Up coordination algorithm
GAMS implementation of the coordination algorithm for linking Top Down and Bottom Up models featured in the paper "Efficient Coordination of Top-Down and Bottom-Up Models for Energy System Design: An Algorithmic Approach" by Paolo Pisciella, E. Ruben Van Beesten and Asgeir Tomasgard. The original codebase was developed by Per Ivar Helgesen.

1. Open the Project file SmallLink.gpr
2. Within GAMS open the main file BendersLink.gms and run it. It will perform the tests reported in table 1 of the paper "Efficient Coordination of Top-Down and Bottom-Up Models for Energy System
Design: An Algorithmic Approach" by Paolo Pisciella, E. Ruben Van Beesten and Asgeir Tomasgard.
3. The results are reported in the file lpmcp_result.gdx
